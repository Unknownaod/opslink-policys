<h1>OpsLinkCAD – Billing & Subscription Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 19th, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 19th, 2025</p>

<p>
This Billing & Subscription Policy (“Policy”) governs all paid features and subscription plans offered by OpsLinkCAD, a system owned and operated by <strong>OpsLink Systems</strong>.
By purchasing or maintaining a subscription, you agree to all terms below.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Subscription Overview</h2>
<p>
OpsLinkCAD offers recurring subscription plans billed automatically every month until cancelled.  
By subscribing, you authorize OpsLink Systems to charge your payment method on a recurring basis.
</p>

<h2>2. Pricing</h2>
<p>
Current pricing for OpsLinkCAD Premier is <strong>$12.99 USD per month</strong>, plus applicable taxes determined by your billing location.
Prices may change at any time with or without notice.
</p>

<h2>3. Taxes</h2>
<p>
Taxes are calculated by our payment processor (Stripe) based on your:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>State/Province</li>
    <li>Local tax rules (GST, HST, VAT, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Displayed tax calculations during checkout are estimates.  
The final charged tax amount is determined entirely by Stripe's certified tax engine.
</p>

<h2>4. Automatic Renewals</h2>
<p>
All subscriptions renew automatically each billing cycle.  
You acknowledge and agree that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will be charged automatically unless you cancel beforehand.</li>
    <li>You must maintain a valid payment method at all times.</li>
    <li>Failed renewals may result in service interruption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Cancellations</h2>
<p>
You may cancel your subscription at any time through your OpsLinkCAD dashboard.  
Cancellation prevents future charges but does <strong>not</strong> refund the current billing period.
</p>

<h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
<p><strong>No refunds are provided under any circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>
The only exceptions are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Duplicate charges</li>
    <li>Billing errors caused by OpsLink Systems or Stripe</li>
</ul>

<p>
Chargebacks will result in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Immediate termination of access</li>
    <li>Permanent ban from OpsLinkCAD</li>
    <li>Submission of evidence to the payment processor</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Payment Processor</h2>
<p>
Payments and billing information are processed securely through <strong>Stripe</strong>.  
OpsLink Systems does not store or process full card numbers at any time.
</p>

<h2>8. Failed Payments</h2>
<p>
If a renewal payment fails:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automatic retries may occur</li>
    <li>Your subscription may be paused or downgraded</li>
    <li>Access to premium features may be revoked</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Upgrades & Downgrades</h2>
<p>
Upgrading takes effect immediately and may charge a prorated amount.  
Downgrades take effect at your next renewal period.
</p>

<h2>10. Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
<p>
If you believe a charge is incorrect, you must report it using our official contact channel.  
Do <strong>not</strong> initiate a dispute through your bank or card issuer without first contacting us.
</p>

<h2>11. Contact for Billing Issues</h2>
<p>
All billing questions, concerns, or disputes must be made through the official OpsLinkCAD Discord server:
</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
    <a href="https://discord.gg/S9QhEYAGzH" target="_blank"><strong>Join here</strong></a>
</p>

<p>
This is the exclusive method of contacting OpsLink Systems regarding billing matters.
</p>

<h2>12. Policy Changes</h2>
<p>
OpsLink Systems may update this Billing Policy at any time.  
Continued use of OpsLinkCAD constitutes acceptance of any updated terms.
